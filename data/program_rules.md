**Policy heuristics used by this demo**
- A course counts once toward the most constrained bucket available (e.g., PSM 601 may satisfy the PLUS requirement; if used there, it won’t also count as an elective).
- Minimum totals: Required = 18 credits (including exactly one PLUS course), Electives = 12 credits, Program total = 30 credits.
- Suggestions prefer filling missing required buckets first, then electives based on interest tags.
